Goal setting is crucial to any good time management strategy. 
To make sure you’re engaging in activities that support your business goals, both short- and long-term, you need to define those goals in terms that are clear and attainable. 
After all, if your goal is to just “to grow your business,” you might find yourself overwhelmed and not know where to begin.

To counteract this paralysis, many companies find that the SMART goals methodology helps keep them on task and on track. 
Standing for “Smart, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound,” SMART goals provide clear, step-by-step tasks to help you get where you need to go.

For example, a SMART goal might be: “Increase traffic to my website from 1,000 to 5,000 unique monthly visitors in the next six months.” When broken down, we can see that this is, indeed, a SMART goal:

Specific: The goal states exactly what needs to be attained.
Measurable: The goal can be measured with a specific tool, in this case, Google Analytics.
Attainable: Rather than vaguely wishing to increase visitors — or setting a goal too high to reach — this goal states a specific number that is well within the realm of possibility but still ambitious.
Relevant: Instead of measuring something like site sessions or overall site visitors, the goal is to reach potential new customers — always crucial when growing a small business.
Time-bound: There is a due date set at the end of six months to attain this goal.
